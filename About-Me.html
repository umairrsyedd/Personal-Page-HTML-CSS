        <p>
        A very honest and polite person, who is always ready to help everyone around me in whatever task I Know,
        Extremely friendly and always looking to make different kinds of friends and meeting people all around the globe,
        After all, friendship means the most to me in no matter what situation I happen to be.
        I am also the kind of person who would get comfortable with anyone within a few minutes, never feel shy or ashamed of myself.
        I also Love to address crowds and sometimes feel that teaching can someday be my second profession, Not that I 
        love to be a teacher but the fact that I'm helping someone else in achieving something in their life makes me 
        extremely happy and It always gives me a special feeling when another person is going ahead because of me.
