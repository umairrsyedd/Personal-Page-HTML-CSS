        <p>
     The technical aspects in my life have aborad varying content, I am aiming at building web applications which deal with complex machine 
     learning algorithms at their back end.
I also love to build new desktop applications which help me in being more productive in my work as I aspire to 
make a better environment not only for myself but also to all those who work with me.
One can always find me busy, working in my room on a personal project, I have the general sense of feeling that 
there is no technology which cannot be overtaken, I spend my time in finding those set of loopholes and working 
on them to the best of my abilities.
</p>
<p>
I also feel that the world has too much to learn specially in the field of technology, there is always an innovation
 which is coming out every day and the best way to enjoy these innovations is to study about them.
<br>
</p><p>The most important field of my interest is no doubt Computer-Vison as I feel there is nothing better 
than learning and understanding how a machine like a computer can process human-like information in
 almost no time.
